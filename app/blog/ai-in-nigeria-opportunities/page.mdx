# Building AI Products in Nigeria: Challenges, Solutions, and Opportunities

**A practical guide to building ML solutions in the Nigerian context, covering infrastructure, data, and market opportunities.**

---

## Why Nigeria Is a Perfect (and Brutal) Testbed

Nigeria is one of the most interesting places on earth to build AI:

- **Huge market** – 200M+ people, young, mobile-first
- **Real problems** – credit, healthcare, logistics, agriculture, betting
- **Hard constraints** – unreliable power, expensive compute, patchy internet

If you can ship a reliable ML product here, you can ship it anywhere.

This post breaks down what it *actually* takes to build AI products in Nigeria—based on shipping systems like **SabiScore** to real users.

## Challenge 1: Infrastructure Reality (Power, Network, Cloud)

Let’s start with the obvious: **nothing is stable by default.**

- Power goes out when you least expect it
- Mobile data dies in the middle of a deployment
- Cloud regions closest to Africa still have higher latency

Instead of complaining, design for it.

```python
# Robust HTTP client with retries (essential in Nigerian conditions)
import httpx
import tenacity

@tenacity.retry(
    stop=tenacity.stop_after_attempt(5),
    wait=tenacity.wait_exponential(multiplier=1, min=1, max=30),
    retry=tenacity.retry_if_exception_type(httpx.RequestError),
)
async def safe_get(url: str) -> dict:
    async with httpx.AsyncClient(timeout=8.0) as client:
        response = await client.get(url)
        response.raise_for_status()
        return response.json()
```

**Design rule**: _Assume every network call fails once._ Your systems should retry gracefully, log smartly, and avoid blocking the user.

## Challenge 2: Data Is Messy, Late, or Non-Existent

You will not find a clean, well-documented "Nigeria-ML-dataset.zip" for your problem.

For SabiScore, we needed:
- Historical match data
- Odds from multiple bookmakers
- League tables and form metrics

What we actually got:
- Inconsistent APIs
- Rate limits that weren’t documented
- Missing data for local leagues

**Solution: Build a data aggregation layer.**

```python
DATA_SOURCES = ["primary_api", "backup_api", "manual_entry"]

async def fetch_match(match_id: str) -> dict:
    errors = []
    for source in DATA_SOURCES:
        try:
            data = await fetch_from_source(source, match_id)
            if validate(data):
                return data
        except Exception as e:  # log properly in real code
            errors.append((source, str(e)))
            continue
    raise RuntimeError(f"No valid data for {match_id}: {errors}")
```

**Key mindset shift**: you’re not just training models—you’re building **data products** in a hostile environment.

## Challenge 3: Talent and Skill Gaps

There are brilliant engineers in Nigeria. But the pipeline from:

> "I took a Coursera ML course"

to:

> "I can deploy, monitor, and maintain an ML system in production"

is still very narrow.

If you're leading an AI product here, you must:

- **Teach production skills**: logging, monitoring, Docker, CI/CD
- **Pair ML with strong backend engineering**
- **Invest in docs and onboarding**

One simple pattern that worked well for us:

```python
# Simple, readable service boundary between ML code and API

class PredictionService:
    def __init__(self, model_registry, feature_store):
        self.model_registry = model_registry
        self.feature_store = feature_store

    def predict(self, request: "PredictionRequest") -> "PredictionResponse":
        features = self.feature_store.build_features(request)
        model = self.model_registry.get_current_model()
        probs = model.predict_proba([features])[0]
        return self._to_response(request, probs, features)
```

This separation makes it easier for more junior engineers to touch API code without breaking ML logic.

## Massive Opportunity: Local Context, Global Tools

Where Nigeria really shines is **context**.

You understand:

- Local betting patterns
- How small businesses actually operate
- The real friction around payments, trust, and UX

Combine that with global tooling:

- **Python + FastAPI** for APIs
- **PostgreSQL** for structured data
- **Redis** for caching
- **React/Next.js** for interfaces

And suddenly you can build products foreign companies can’t:

- Credit scoring for informal businesses
- AI-powered agri-tools for smallholder farmers
- Sports prediction tools tailored to Nigerian leagues

## Practical Opportunities You Can Build *Now*

Here are a few ideas that sit at the intersection of **feasible** and **high-impact**:

1. **"Explain my bet" assistant** for sports bettors
2. **Creditworthiness scoring** for POS agents and micro-SMEs
3. **Logistics ETA prediction** for Lagos delivery routes
4. **"Power outage forecaster"** using public data + private signals
5. **Fraud detection** for local fintech transaction streams

Each one is:

- Data-backed
- Technically approachable
- Pain-killer, not vitamin

## Lessons From Shipping SabiScore

What I’d tell any Nigerian founder building AI in 2025:

- **Start simple**. One model, one narrow use case, one metric.
- **Bias for reliability over fancy models**. Users don’t care if it’s a transformer or a tree—they care if it works.
- **Educate your users**. Many people are using an ML product for the first time.
- **Charge something, even small**. It validates that you’re solving a real problem.

## Call to Action

If you're building ML products in Nigeria or Africa and want:

- A second pair of eyes on your architecture
- Help getting from notebook → production
- Someone who has fought these exact constraints
