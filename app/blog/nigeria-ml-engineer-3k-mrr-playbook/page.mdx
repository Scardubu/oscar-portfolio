# From Lagos to $3k MRR: A 12-Month Playbook for Nigerian ML Engineers Going Global

**How I went from Can you even keep the lights on? to $3k+ MRR from international clients c and how you can copy the exact steps.**

---

## The Question That Changed Everything

On a sales call in 2022, after 45 minutes of discussing architecture, deployment, and KPIs, the prospect paused and asked:

> Wait, where are you based?

Lagos, Nigeria, I replied.

Another pause.

> Can you even keep the lights on?

I lost that client.

Not because of my skills.
Not because of price.
But because of my location.

Fast forward to December 2024:

- ✅ **$1,655 MRR** from international clients.
- ✅ **350+ users** on my own ML product.
- ✅ **99.9% uptime** on a system I run from Lagos.
- ✅ Clients across the US and Europe.

This is the **12-month playbook** I wish I had when I started c for Nigerian (and African) engineers who want to work globally *without* relocating.

## Part 1 c The Reality of Building from Nigeria (No Sugarcoating)

Before we talk strategy, we need to be honest about constraints.

### Infrastructure Tax

**Power:**

- Grid power: **40 hours/day** on a good week.
- Generator: fuel + maintenance.
- UPS + laptop battery: non-negotiable.

**Internet:**

- Primary: fiber (e.g. 50 Mbps down).
- Backup: 4G hotspot.
- Outages: 20c3/month, sometimes lasting hours.

You dont get reliability for free. You *buy* it with redundancy.

### Finance, Payments, and Stereotypes

- Stripe doesnt support Nigerian entities directly.
- PayPal withdrawals can take weeks.
- Wire transfers have brutal fees and FX spreads.
- Some people see Nigeria and think 419 before they think software engineer.

This isnt to discourage you.
Its to explain **why you need a system**, not vibes.

## Part 2 c Months 10c3: Build Proof Before You Pitch

The biggest mistake I see African devs make: **pitch first, proof later.**

Flip it.

### Step 1: Ship One Real Product (Not a Tutorial Clone)

For me, that product was **SabiScore** c my sports prediction platform.

Your product should:

- Solve a problem a real person cares about.
- Be live on the internet (not localhost).
- Have *some* metric you can show:
  - Users.
  - Accuracy.
  - Uptime.
  - Revenue (even small).

If you dont know what to build, ask:

> Whats one annoying problem I could fix for my past self?

### Step 2: Turn It into a Case Study, Not Just a GitHub Repo

Dont just drop a link to a repo in your CV.
Write a short case study covering:

- **Problem:** what was broken/inefficient before?
- **Approach:** architecture, stack, key decisions.
- **Results:** even if its:
  - 4 users who still log in every week.
  - 71% accuracy on a real dataset.
  - 99.9% uptime over the last N days.

Publish it on:

- Your own blog.
- LinkedIn.
- A relevant community (IndieHackers, dev Twitter, etc.).

### Step 3: Get 10c2 Real Testimonials

Instead of waiting for the perfect client:

- Offer a **small, scoped engagement** to 10c2 people:
  - e.g. Ill deploy your ML model behind a FastAPI endpoint with monitoring for $200.
- Over-deliver.
- Ask for a testimonial with:
  - Name.
  - Role.
  - Company.
  - One clear result.

Now you have:

- 1 product.
- 1 case study.
- 10c2 testimonials.

This is your **starting asset stack.**

## Part 3 c Months 30c6: Turn Proof into Paying Clients

### Step 4: Position Yourself as X for Y, Not I Do ML

Bad positioning:

- ML engineer. I build models.

Better positioning:

- Full-stack ML engineer helping B2B SaaS go from notebook to production in 4 weeks.
- MLOps + infra for teams stuck at 97% uptime with flaky ML APIs.

Fill this in:

> **I help [WHO] achieve [RESULT] using [TOOLS/APPROACH].**

Then make sure your:

- Portfolio.
- LinkedIn.
- Upwork profile.

all say *that*, not just a tech stack list.

### Step 5: Channels That Actually Worked for Me

1. **Upwork (controversial, but it worked)**

   - Hyper-specific title and overview.
   - 50+ highly targeted proposals in the first months.
   - Only applied where I was 100% confident I could win.

2. **Content (this blog)**

   - 1 post/week aimed at problems my target clients had:
     - Our models never make it to production.
     - Our API keeps going down.
   - Shared on LinkedIn and Twitter.

3. **Direct outreach (cold, but thoughtful)**

   - Short emails/DMs:
     - Saw youre hiring for X. Heres a case study of me doing that.
     - I built Y, which is similar to your problem Z.

The combo of **proof + positioning + persistence** is what landed the first 30c4 clients.

### Step 6: The First 3 Clients (and What They Taught Me)

- **Client #1:**
  - Small project (a few hundred dollars).
  - Over-delivered.
  - Got a 5-star review and testimonial.

- **Client #20c3:**
  - Found me because of:
    - The first review.
    - The product I had shipped.
    - The blog posts.

Lesson:

> You dont need 100 people to believe in you.
> You need 1 person to take a bet, then you compound from there.

## Part 4 c Months 60c12: From Random Gigs to a Real Business

At some point, Ill do anything for anyone stops scaling.

### Step 7: Productized Services > Random Hourly Work

Examples of productized offers:

- Production Readiness Audit for Your ML System c $X.
- Deploy Your ML PoC to Production in 14 Days c $Y.
- Ongoing MLOps Support c $Z/month.

Why this works better:

- Clear scope.
- Clear pricing.
- Easier to say no to misaligned work.

### Step 8: Raising Your Rates to Global Levels

Year 1 thinking:

- Cost of living in Lagos is lower, so I should charge less.

Reality:

- Your infra, software, and opportunity costs are priced in USD.
- Good clients care about **outcomes** and **trust**, not your rent.

Example evolution:

- Year 1: $200c40/hr equivalent.
- Year 2: $800c120/hr equivalent through fixed-price packages.

Rule of thumb:

> Close 30c5 good clients at a fair global rate instead of 20 lowball offers.

## Part 5 c Systems That Turn Your Location into an Advantage

### Step 9: Reliability as Your Edge

Most clients secretly worry:

- Will this person disappear?
- Will calls drop?
- Will they miss deadlines because of power/internet?

You can flip this:

- Show your **personal uptime setup**:
  - Generator + UPS + dual ISP.
  - 99.9% uptime on your own product.
- Make it part of your story:
  - Ive *had* to engineer reliability in Lagos. Thats why Im obsessive about your uptime too.

### Step 10: Communication That Builds Trust Fast

Simple systems:

- Clear hours in your email signature with WAT + EST/PST.
- Daily or weekly update templates:

  ```
  Daily Update c [Date]

  Completed:
  - ...

  In Progress:
  - ...

  Blockers:
  - ...

  Next Steps:
  - ...
  ```

- Calendly link to remove timezone friction.

These small things make you look *more* reliable than many local devs.

## Part 6 c What $3k MRR Actually Looks Like

You dont need 50 clients.

A realistic mix might be:

- 10c2 productized projects/month ($1k0c1.5k each).
- 1 recurring retainer ($5000c1k).
- A small SaaS component (like SabiScore) adding $2000c500 MRR.

What matters is:

- Predictability of income.
- Quality of clients.
- How much of your time you control.

## Part 7 c A 12-Week Action Plan You Can Start This Month

### Weeks 10c4

- Ship 1 real product.
- Write 1 serious case study.
- Fix your personal infra basics.

### Weeks 50c8

- Apply to 50+ relevant roles/projects with tailored proposals.
- Publish 4 blog posts addressing the problems you see in those roles.
- Land your first paying client.

### Weeks 90c12

- Turn what worked into 10c2 productized services.
- Raise your rates for new work.
- Start saying no to red-flag clients.

You wont copy my exact journey.
But you can absolutely hit **your** version of $3k MRR.

## Final Thoughts: Your Location Is a Feature, Not a Bug

Heres what I realized after 2 years:

- Lagos gives me **lower costs and higher margins**.
- Being on hard mode forces me to be more disciplined.
- My story is more memorable than just another dev in SF.

Your job is not to hide where youre from.
Your job is to **turn it into a competitive advantage.**
