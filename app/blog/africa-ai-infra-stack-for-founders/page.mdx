# The AI Infrastructure Stack I Recommend to Every African Founder

**If you're building an AI product from Africa, your infra has to survive power cuts, shaky internet, and payment headaches. Here's the stack I recommend after shipping real ML systems from Lagos.**

## Why Your Infra Stack Matters More in Africa

If you're building from Lagos, Nairobi, Accra, or Johannesburg, you're not just fighting product-market fit.
You're fighting:

- Unreliable power.
- ISP outages.
- Payment providers that don't support your country.
- Skeptical international users.

The wrong infra choices can:

- Lock you into expensive services you can't pay for in USD easily.
- Make it impossible to debug outages.
- Kill trust at the exact moment your product starts taking off.

After running my own ML platform and working with clients, this is the **opinionated, battle-tested stack** I recommend to early-stage African founders.

This post is not sponsored. It's what I actually use or would use at different stages.

---

## Principle #1: Reliability First, Fancy Later

Your infra should prioritize:

1. **Uptime:** your product should be available when your users need it.
2. **Simplicity:** fewer moving parts, fewer 3 AM incidents.
3. **Cost clarity:** you should know exactly what you'll pay at 100, 1,000, and 10,000 users.

You do *not* need:

- Kubernetes on day 1.
- 7 different AWS services.
- A microservice zoo.

You *do* need:

- One solid API.
- One solid database.
- One solid way to observe what's going on.

## Part 1: Hosting & Compute

### Stage 1: Idea - Prototype (0-100 Users)

For the first version:

- **Backend:** FastAPI on a single VM or platform like Render/Fly.io.
- **Frontend:** Next.js on Vercel or Netlify.
- **Database:** Managed Postgres (smallest tier).

Why this works:

- Simple mental model.
- Low cost.
- Easy to debug.

Even at this stage, you can still be disciplined:

- Use environment variables properly.
- Configure logging.
- Create a `/health` endpoint.

### Stage 2: First Paying Customers (100-1,000 Users)

At this point, you're worried about:

- Outages during peak hours.
- Latency from African users hitting US/EU servers.

Recommendations:

- **Compute:**
  - 2 small API instances behind a load balancer.
  - Keep it on one cloud (e.g. DigitalOcean, Hetzner, or AWS Lightsail).

- **Regions:**
  - If most users are in Africa, pick a region that minimizes latency (e.g. Europe for West Africa, or nearest reliable region).

- **Auto-restart:**
  - Use something like systemd, Docker restart policies, or a managed platform with health checks.

### Stage 3: Scaling (1,000+ Users)

Now your questions become:

- How do we handle spikes?
- How do we avoid single points of failure?

Without going full enterprise cloud, you can:

- Add a **CDN** (Cloudflare) in front of everything.
- Scale DB up to a bigger managed tier.
- Introduce a queue if you have heavy background jobs.

Still no Kubernetes. Still no 20 microservices.

## Part 2: Data & Databases

### Primary Database: Managed Postgres

Why Postgres:

- Strong ecosystem.
- Good support from multiple providers.
- Works great for most SaaS workloads.

What I look for in a provider:

- Automated backups.
- Point-in-time recovery.
- Easy upgrades.

### Caching Layer: Redis (Cloud or Managed)

Use Redis when:

- You have expensive ML predictions you don't want to recompute.
- You want to store sessions or short-lived tokens.

Patterns that work well:

- Cache ML predictions with smart TTLs.
- Cache rendered pages for anonymous users.

You don't need to overcomplicate this.
A single Redis instance (with a replica at higher scale) can go a long way.

## Part 3 - Monitoring, Logging, and Alerts

If you're building from Africa, you can't babysit your app 24/7.
You need software to watch it for you.

### Minimal Stack (Free or Cheap)

- **Uptime monitoring:** UptimeRobot or similar.
- **Error tracking:** Sentry.
- **Metrics:**
  - Self-hosted Prometheus + Grafana.
  - Or a lightweight managed solution if budget allows.

### What to Monitor (At Minimum)

- Uptime on main endpoints.
- Error rate by endpoint.
- Latency (p95) on your core API.
- Database health: connections, disk, CPU.

The goal:

> Know about problems before your users do.

## Part 4 - Payments & Billing From Africa

One of the biggest headaches for African founders is **getting paid**.

### Option 1: US/EU Entity + Stripe (Heavier, Long-Term)

- Set up a US LLC (e.g. via Stripe Atlas or another provider).
- Get a US bank account (Mercury, Wise Business, etc.).
- Use Stripe for:
  - Subscriptions.
  - One-off payments.

Pros:

- Access to the full Stripe ecosystem.
- Easier for US/EU customers to trust.

Cons:

- Setup cost.
- Compliance and taxes.

### Option 2: Fintech Intermediaries (Faster Start)

- Payoneer.
- Wise Business.

You can:

- Receive payments from US/EU as if you had a local account.
- Withdraw to your Nigerian (or African) bank.

Pros:

- Faster setup.
- Good for early-stage.

Cons:

- Higher fees.
- Not as clean as Stripe at scale.

### My Recommendation

- If you are serious about SaaS for global customers:
  - **Plan for a US/EU entity eventually.**
- If you are just validating an idea:
  - Start with Wise/Payoneer.
  - Keep your infra cost low until revenue justifies a proper entity.

## Part 5 - Putting It All Together: A Default Stack for African AI Products

Here's a concrete default you can copy and then customize.

### Backend

- **Language:** Python.
- **Framework:** FastAPI.
- **Serving models:**
  - Plain Python processes for v1.
  - Optionally, a separate model service once load increases.

### Frontend

- **Framework:** Next.js.
- **Hosting:** Vercel (free/low-cost tiers to start).

### Infra & Data

- **Hosting:**
  - DigitalOcean / Hetzner / Render / Fly.io.
- **Database:** managed Postgres.
- **Cache:** Redis (managed or Redis Cloud free tier).

### Observability

- UptimeRobot (free tier) for uptime.
- Sentry (free tier) for errors.
- Prometheus + Grafana on a small VM for metrics.

### Security Basics

- HTTPS everywhere (Let's Encrypt / Cloudflare).
- Environment variables for secrets (NOT in Git).
- Regular backups.

## Part 6 - Common Mistakes I See African Founders Make

1. **Overengineering too early**
   - Kubernetes + microservices at 0 users.
   - Result: more things to break.

2. **Ignoring monitoring**
   - You only find out about downtime when users complain on WhatsApp.

3. **Putting infra costs on personal cards with no plan**
   - USD subscriptions that are unsustainable.

4. **Choosing tools that don't support your country**
   - Payment providers.
   - Banks.

5. **Not designing for flaky connectivity**
   - No retries.
   - No offline-friendly UX.

Each of these is avoidable with a bit of planning.

## Part 7 - A Simple Infra Checklist for African AI Startups

Use this as your starting point:

- [ ] One main API with health checks.
- [ ] One managed Postgres instance with backups.
- [ ] One Redis instance for caching.
- [ ] Uptime monitoring on critical endpoints.
- [ ] Error tracking plugged into your app.
- [ ] Basic dashboards for latency and errors.
- [ ] A payment path that actually works from your country.

If you check all of these, you are already ahead of many well-funded teams.
